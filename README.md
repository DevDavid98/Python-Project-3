This project is called Phrase Hunter or basically hangman, using Object orientated Python.

The character.py file basically stores the letter that has been guessed and checks to see if the letter has or has not been guessed

The phrases.py file adds all the words the player will be guessing and adds the logic to have the letter appear in the spot where it is supposed to be within the phrase.

The game.py file litterally runs the whole game within a loop and finishes when the player decides to.

The comments in the files go into a little bit of what each portion of the code does.
